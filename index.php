<!-- The first shown below is the Home Page. This will be what the user sees first. It’s
filename must be index.php. The prototype shown below is purposively simple and
focuses on functionality. It’s up to you to make it look good.
8. Header. The page title can be whatever you’d like. You need to provide a brief
description (be sure to mention it is assignment #1 for COMP3512 at Mount Royal
University), styled nicely, about what this site is about, what technologies you are using,
the group member names, and the URL for the github repo. Notice also there are buttons
or links that will appear on every PHP page. -->
