<!-- The next shown is the Browse Page. Initially it will display all the races for the season.
When the user selects a race, then display more information for the race as well as a list
of qualifying results and race results. When we learn JavaScript, we will have a clean way
to hide/show data. In PHP, your page will need to “know” whether to display race results
or not. If there is a raceId passed to the page, then display results. -->
